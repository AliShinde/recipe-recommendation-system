Beat in melted butter and strain the batter to remove any large lumps. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Just before using, stir batter and pour in as much soda water as needed to make a thin batter, the consistency of light cream.",
      "Make each crepe separately! Heat a 6 1/2 inch pan (small frying pan with sloping sides) until very hot. Brush with cooking oil. When it starts to smoke, remove from heat and pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter into the pan. Spread batter with a ladle until crepe is the right size if possible. Quickly swirl the pan around so the batter flows to the sides, thinly coating the entire bottom. A palacsinta is supposed to be very thin, as thin as it can be without being lacy.",
      "Put the pan back on the heat for about 1 minute, then give it a couple of good jerks to loosen the crepe. Flip it if you can or turn it over by hand using a spatula to lift it up out of the pan first. Cook briefly on the second side and slide it onto a warm dish or pie plate. Keep the crepes warm as you continue cooking the remaining batter.",
